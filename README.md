# dashball
Dashball? yea, exactly that or something, a Unity game of some sort.
I didn't set out to make it, it just happened while I was testing some
things...


# Controls

Jump - X
Move - Left Arrow, Right Arrow
Dash - Direction + X 
        e.g Left + X - dash left
            Right + Up - dash up towards right diagonally

Restart Level - Backspace


Dash and Jump reset when you land on a block.
